# trump crap

For some reason, Donald Trump made a blog.

For some reason, this may be of value to some future scholars.

God help us.

## Instructions

Run `trumpthoughts.blog.R` to download everything off this blog. This will generate an output called `posts.csv` containing the posts and a folder called `videos/` containing the videos. The repository has a full scrape of the site at the time of the last commit, so you needn't actually scrape it yourself.

Binary attachments are stored in the `video/` and `image/` subdirectories as appropriate.
